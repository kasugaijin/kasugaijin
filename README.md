- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben, @kasugaijin
- 👀 I’m interested in ... hiking with my dog and heading in the bush in my Land Rover Disco I.
- 💞️ I currently lead a technical team in government and want to transition to tech as a full-stack developer.
- 📫 How to reach me ... www.linkedin.com/in/robinsonb
- Fun Fact: I lived in Kasugai, Japan for a year, and my username is a play on being a (foreign) resident in the city.
