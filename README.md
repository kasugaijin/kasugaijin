- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben, @kasugaijin
- 👀 I’m interested in ... hiking with my dog and heading in the bush in my Land Rover Disco I.
- 💞️ I’m looking to transition into tech and bring a lot of strong transferable skills.
- 📫 How to reach me ...@kasugaijin on The Odin Project discord server.
- Fun Fact: I lived in Kasugai, Japan for a year, and my username is a play on being a (foreign) resident in the city.
